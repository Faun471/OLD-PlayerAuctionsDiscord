# PlayerAuctionsDiscord

[![GitHub release](https://badgen.net/github/release/Faun471/PlayerAuctionsDiscord)](https://github.com/Faun471/PlayerAuctionsDiscord/releases)

## Introduction

I was using DiscordSRV's alerts.yml feature to send embeds for player auctions, but I found out that potions, tipped arrows, player heads, etc., are either impossible to implement, or would be too complicated. 
This plugin aims to solve that.

This plugin sends an embed to a discord channel when someone sells, buys, or removes an item in the auction house. Here's a quick example.

## Required Dependencies

---

- [DiscordSRV](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/discordsrv.18494/)

- [PlayerAuctions](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%AD%90-player-auctions%E2%AD%90-%E2%9E%A2-let-your-players-sell-items-1-7-1-17-1.83073/)

These plugins are **required.** The plugin will never work without both of them.
